# One qubit as a Universal Approximant

In this repository one can find all the code related to the paper *One 
qubit as a Universal Approximant*, [arXiv:2102.04032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04032) 

- The files `main*.py` summarize all the code needed for performing optimizations as
explained in the paper. 
- The inner engine of the simulations is written in 
`ApproximantNN.py`
- The file `chi2.py` corresponds to a code for painting final results on $\chi^2$
- The file `painter_experimental.py` paints all the different approximations of
different functions
- All results are stored in the results folder, and `summary.csv` is an index for them
